## Features

-   **Multi-Language Support:** Executes code in Python, JavaScript, C, and C++.
-   **Secure Sandboxing:** Uses Node.js `child_process` to run user code in isolated processes, preventing it from accessing the server.
-   **Timeout Protection:** Automatically terminates processes that run for more than 10 seconds to prevent infinite loops.
-   **Clean User Interface:** A modern, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS and the Monaco editor (from VS Code).
-   **REST API:** A clear client-server architecture with a single API endpoint to handle code execution.

## Technology Stack

-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
-   **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API)
-   **Core Logic:** Node.js `child_process` module (`spawn` and `execSync`)
